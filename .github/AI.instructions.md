# AI Integration in PulseGov - Using OpenAI API for Feedback Analysis

## Overview
PulseGov utilizes artificial intelligence to enhance the feedback process. We integrate OpenAI's API for sentiment analysis, topic categorization, and intent detection. Additionally, we use `Neuron AI` for performance tracking and analysis. Below is a detailed guide for integrating and using AI features in the platform.

### **AI Features**
1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Classify feedback as positive, neutral, or negative based on the content of the feedback message.
2. **Topic Clustering**: Automatically categorize feedback into relevant topics (e.g., UX, performance, access).
3. **Urgency Detection**: Classify the urgency level of the feedback as low, medium, or high.
4. **Smart Routing**: Based on feedback category and sentiment, route the feedback to the appropriate department.
